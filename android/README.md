# CS Games - Sample Android App

This project will guide you setting up your environment to build and run a sample Android application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed before beginning:

- Latest version of Android Studio (3.3.1)
- Recent version of the Android SDK (at least API 28)

You can download these from the [Android Developer website](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).

> **NOTE:** If you have a Mac computer running macOS 10.13.6 or later, you may also be interested in our [Sample iOS app](https://github.com/mirego/csgames-sample-mobile/blob/master/ios/), which uses Xcode and the latest iOS SDK.

## Getting started

First, clone the project from Github:

```
git clone git@github.com:mirego/csgames-sample-mobile.git
```

Then, in Android Studio: 

- Select **Import project (Eclipse, ADT, Gradle, etc.)** in the Welcome Screen, go find the repository you just cloned, and click **OK**.
- Once the project is open, click on **Sync Project with Gradle Files** in the main toolbar (or navigate to `Tools -> Android` in the application menu and select the same option).

Once you see a `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` notice in the Gradle Console, your environment should be ready to build and run the project.

## Building the project

The project should have already been configured as an Android project in Android Studio, therefore you should see a target named `app` in the main toolbar, with **Play** and **Debug** buttons on its right.

Press on the **Debug** icon, and if you don't already have one, [create a new Android Virtual Device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html), then select it to run the project.

Once the app appears running in your Virtual Device, your environment is ready for the competition.

If you have questions about the project or encounter any problem while configuring your environment, please don't hesistate to contact the [project author](https://github.com/ebelair) or submit an [issue](https://github.com/mirego/csgames-sample-mobile/issues).
